# ? FIXED: Blueprint Interface Compatibility

## What Was Wrong?
Your game was crashing with:
```
Assertion failed: "Do not directly call Event functions in Interfaces. Call Execute_SelectLocation instead."
```

## What We Fixed
Changed **12 interface function calls** across **2 files** to use the correct `Execute_` wrapper pattern for Blueprint compatibility.

## Files Modified
1. `ScheduleComponent.cpp` - 11 fixes
2. `ScheduleEntryData.cpp` - 1 fix

## Quick Test Steps

### 1. Compile the Project
```
Right-click EchoesOfAffection.uproject ? Generate Visual Studio project files
Open in Visual Studio
Build Solution (Ctrl+Shift+B)
```

### 2. Test in Editor
1. Open your level with BP_Lianne
2. Play in Editor (PIE)
3. Watch for time changes (10:20, etc.)
4. **Expected:** No crash, NPC should move to location
5. **Check Output Log:** Should see "? Action started successfully"

### 3. Verify the Fix
Look for these log messages (no errors):
```
?? Starting action 'Morning Activity' for BP_Lianne_C_1 (Priority: 50)
   ?? Selected location: <location coordinates>
   ? Action started successfully
```

## What If I See Red Squiggles?

Visual Studio's IntelliSense might show errors like:
- `E1696: cannot open source file`
- `E0276: name followed by '::' must be a class or namespace name`

**These are FALSE POSITIVES.** Ignore them. The code will compile fine.

**Fix IntelliSense:**
1. Right-click Solution ? Rescan Solution
2. Or just restart Visual Studio
3. Or ignore them (they won't affect gameplay)

- `SUMMARY_Interface_Fix.md` - Complete summary of all changes

## Still Having Issues?

1. Check Output Log for error messages
2. Verify Blueprint selector is assigned in Schedule Entry
3. Verify Action is assigned in Schedule Entry
4. See `DIAGNOSTICS.md` for troubleshooting steps

## What's Next?

Your NPCs should now:
? Select locations without crashing
? Execute actions correctly
? Work with both Blueprint AND C++ implementations
