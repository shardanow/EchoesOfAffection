# Summary: Multiple Locations in Composite Actions

## Changes Made

### 1. Added LocationSelector Support to MoveToLocation
- **File**: `ScheduleAction_MoveToLocation.h`
- **Change**: Added `LocationSelector` property
- **Purpose**: Each MoveToLocation can now select its own destination

### 2. Enhanced Location Selection Logic
- **File**: `ScheduleAction_MoveToLocation.cpp`
- **Changes**:
  - Check for own LocationSelector first
  - Fall back to Context location if no selector
  - Enhanced logging to show which location and tags are being used

### 3. Fixed AlreadyAtGoal Handling
- **Issue**: When actor was already at destination, action completed instantly
- **Fix**: Always add to ActiveMovements map, even when AlreadyAtGoal
- **Result**: Proper tracking and sequential progression

## Usage

### Option 1: Single Location (Old Way - Still Works)
```
ScheduleEntry
  ?? LocationSelector: ActorTag("Location.Fields")
  ?? Composite Action
       ?? MoveToLocation (no selector)
       ?? Wait
       ?? MoveToLocation (no selector)
```
Result: All movements go to same location.

### Option 2: Multiple Locations (New Way)
```
ScheduleEntry
  ?? LocationSelector: NONE
  ?? Composite Action
       ?? MoveToLocation
   ?    ?? LocationSelector: ActorTag("Location.Fields")
       ?? Wait
       ?? MoveToLocation
   ?    ?? LocationSelector: ActorTag("Location.Town")
       ?? Wait
```
Result: Each movement goes to different location.

## Log Output
