# ? Reward System: Logging + Phase Support Added!

## ?? What Was Fixed

### 1?? **Added Detailed Logging**
Now you can see **exactly** what's happening with rewards:

```
?????? QuestSubsystem::OnQuestCompletedInternal - Quest 'Q_CollectApples' completed!
   ? QuestAsset is valid, processing rewards...
?????? QuestRewardSystem::ProcessQuestRewards called for Quest 'Q_CollectApples'
   - PrimaryRewards count: 3
   - BonusTags count: 1
   ?? Granting reward: Type=0 (Item), for Quest 'Q_CollectApples'
```

### 2?? **Added Phase Reward Support**
Phases can NOW grant rewards when they complete:

**Before:**
```cpp
Phase: "P_CollectApples"
  (No rewards) ?
```

**After:**
```cpp
Phase: "P_CollectApples"
  PhaseRewards:
    - Item: RedApple x5
    - Experience: 25
```

## ?? **How to Use**

### Step 1: Set Rewards in Quest Data Asset

Open `DA_Quest_Apples` ? **RewardsOnComplete**:

```
RewardsOnComplete:
  PrimaryRewards:
    [0] Type: Experience, Amount: 50
    [1] Type: Currency, Amount: 100
  BonusTags:
    [0] Quest.Completed.CollectApples
```

### Step 2: Test in PIE

Start quest ? Complete it ? Check logs:

```
?????? QuestRewardSystem::ProcessQuestRewards called...
```

**If you see:**
```
?? No rewards to grant! RewardsOnComplete is empty in Quest Asset.
```
? **Fix:** Fill `RewardsOnComplete` in DA!

## ?? **Next Steps**

### If Rewards Still Don't Work:

1. **Check DA is configured:**
   ```
   Content/QuestSystem/DA_Quest_Apples
     ? RewardsOnComplete ? Add rewards
   ```

2. **Check logs for:**
   ```
   ?? QuestSubsystem::OnQuestCompletedInternal
   ?? QuestRewardSystem::ProcessQuestRewards
   ```

3. **If logs show "empty rewards":**
   ? Your DA doesn't have rewards configured

4. **If no logs at all:**
   ? `OnQuestCompletedInternal` not called
   ? Check `OnQuestCompleted` delegate binding
