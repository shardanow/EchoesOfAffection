## FAQ

### Q: Does this work in multiplayer?
**A:** The system is single-player ready. For multiplayer, you'll need to replicate the time state from server to clients. We'll add a multiplayer example in future versions.

### Q: Can I customize day length?
**A:** Yes! Set `RealSecondsPerGameDay` in TimeOfDaySettings. Default is 1200 seconds (20 minutes).

### Q: How do I pause time in cutscenes?
**A:** Call `TimeOfDaySubsystem->PauseTime()` before cutscene, `ResumeTime()` after.

### Q: Can I have multiple time systems?
**A:** Each World has one TimeOfDaySubsystem. For multiple time zones, extend the system.

### Q: What's the performance impact?
**A:** Very minimal. ~0.01ms per frame with default settings. See Performance Benchmarks above.

### Q: Is this compatible with other plugins?
**A:** Yes! The system uses standard UE5 interfaces and doesn't conflict with other plugins.

### Q: Can I use this commercially?
**A:** Yes, see LICENSE file for details.

### Q: How do I report bugs?
**A:** Open an issue on GitHub with:
  - UE version
  - Steps to reproduce
  - Expected vs actual behavior
  - Relevant logs
